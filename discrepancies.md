| Book / ref           | KJV                                                                                       | NIV                                                               | Contradiction                                                                                                                        |

| **Daniel 3:25**         | He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. | He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.” | KJV is moneitheism. NIV reads polytheistic |
| **Luke 2:14**        | Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. | Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”  | Is it universally all men vs selectively only to those receiving favor? |
| **Acts 12:4**           | And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. |  After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. | Easter, a christian festival vs Passover a jewish holiday? |
| **Romans 8:1**       | There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. | Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, | No condition in NIV? |
| **Revelation 22:14** |  Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. | Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. | Obey the commandments = Maintain hygeine? |
| **Revelation 22:19** | And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. | And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll. | Book of life = tree of life? |
| **Isaiah 14:12**     | How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! | How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth,  you who once laid low the nations! | Lucifer or morning star? Revelations 1 22:16 says " “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.” |
| **Luke 2:33**        | And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. | The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. | Is it Joseph the child's father? |
| **Mark 1:2**         | As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. | as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way” | All prophets, major prophets or just Isaiah |
| **Philippians 2:6**  | Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God | Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; | Equality through Robbery? |
| **1 John 5:7–8**   | Includes explicit Trinitarian line: “...in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.” ([Bible Gateway][1]) | NIV’s text reads simply “there are three that testify...” (no “in heaven... three are one” sentence). ([Bible Gateway][2]) | That missing sentence is a **doctrinally heavy proof-text**, not a numbering shift.                  |
| **Mark 16:9–20**   | KJV prints the “long ending” (post-resurrection appearances + signs). ([Bible Gateway][3])                                                  | NIV brackets it with: “**The earliest manuscripts ... do not have verses 9–20.**” ([Bible Gateway][4])                     | KJV contains a **whole ending section** that NIV explicitly warns is absent from earliest witnesses. |
| **John 7:53–8:11** | KJV prints the whole “woman caught in adultery” story. ([Bible Gateway][5])                                                                 | NIV note: “**The earliest manuscripts ... do not have John 7:53—8:11.**” ([Bible Gateway][6])                              | It’s an entire famous narrative being flagged as **textually disputed**—not a renumbering artifact.  |

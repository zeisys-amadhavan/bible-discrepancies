| Book / ref           | KJV                                                                                       | NIV                                                               | Contradiction                                                                                                                        |

| **Daniel 3:25**         | He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. | He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.” | KJV is moneitheism. NIV reads polytheistic |
| **Luke 2:14**        | Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. | Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”  | Is it universally all men vs selectively only to those receiving favor? |
| **Acts 12:4**           | And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. |  After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. | Easter, a christian festival vs Passover a jewish day? |
| **Romans 8:1**       | There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. | Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, | No condition in NIV? |
| **Revelation 22:14** |  Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. | Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. | Obey the commandments = Maintain hygeine? |
| **Revelation 22:19** | And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. | And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll. | Book of life = tree of life? |
| **Isaiah 14:12**     | “How art thou fallen from heaven, **O Lucifer**, son of the morning! …” ([Bible Gateway][1])     | “... **morning star**, son of the dawn! ...” ([Bible Gateway][2])                  | “Lucifer” reads like a **proper name** to many (nudges “this is Satan”); “morning star” keeps it **obviously metaphor/taunt imagery**.                                  |
| **Luke 2:33**        | “And **Joseph** and his mother marvelled …” ([Bible Gateway][7])                                 | “The child’s **father** and mother marveled …” ([Bible Gateway][8])                | **Doctrinal sensitivity**: “Joseph” avoids any “biological father” misread; “father” is natural narrative phrasing but can feel theologically blurrier to some readers. |
| **Acts 12:4**        | “...intending after **Easter** to bring him forth …” ([Bible Gateway][9])                        | “...after the **Passover**.” ([Bible Gateway][10])                                 | Not mere wording: **different festival framing** (Christian “Easter” vs explicitly Jewish “Passover”).                                                                  |
| **Mark 1:2**         | “As it is written **in the prophets** …” ([Bible Gateway][11])                                   | “as it is written **in Isaiah the prophet** …” ([Bible Gateway][12])               | Attribution issue: Mark’s line is a **composite**; “Isaiah” can trigger “wait, not all of that is Isaiah,” while “the prophets” sidesteps that friction.                |
| **Philippians 2:6**  | “...thought it not **robbery** to be equal with God:” ([Bible Gateway][13])                      | “...equality with God … **used to his own advantage** …” ([Bible Gateway][14])     | Different foreground: KJV sounds like **legitimacy/status** (“not theft”); NIV stresses **non-exploitation/humility** (“didn’t leverage it”).                           |
| **Romans 8:1**       | “...no condemnation … who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” ([Bible Gateway][15]) | “...no condemnation **for those who are in Christ Jesus** …” ([Bible Gateway][16]) | The “no condemnation” line reads **behavior-qualified** in KJV; NIV states it **without that added qualifier** in the verse.                                            |
| **John 1:18**        | “...the **only begotten Son** …” ([Bible Gateway][17])                                           | “...the one and only Son, **who is himself God** …” ([Bible Gateway][18])          | NIV’s main line explicitly calls the Son **“God”** here; KJV doesn’t say that outright in this verse.                                                                   |
| **Revelation 22:14** | “Blessed are they that **do his commandments** …” ([Bible Gateway][19])                          | “Blessed are those who **wash their robes** …” ([Bible Gateway][20])               | Different basis for access/right: **obedience framing** vs **cleansing/robe-washing** imagery.                                                                          |
| **Revelation 22:19** | “...take away his part out of the **book of life** …” ([Bible Gateway][21])                      | “...any share in the **tree of life** …” ([Bible Gateway][22])                     | Not a nuance—**different object entirely** (“book” vs “tree”).                                                                                                          |

| Book / ref           | KJV (verbatim)                                                                                       | NIV (short excerpt)                                                              | What breaks semantically                                                                                                                                    |

| **Daniel 3:25**      | He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. | “...the fourth looks like **a son of the gods**.” ([Bible Gateway][2])           | **Huge Christology shift**: KJV reads like a direct “Son of God” identification; NIV reads like a pagan king’s polytheistic phrasing (“one of the gods”).   |
| **Luke 2:14**        | “...on earth peace, **good will toward men**.” ([Bible Gateway][3])                                  | “...peace to those **on whom his favor rests**.” ([Bible Gateway][4])            | **Universal vs selective**: KJV sounds broadly benevolent to “men”; NIV restricts peace to a subset (those receiving favor).                                |
| **Acts 12:4**        | “...intending after **Easter** to bring him forth...” ([Bible Gateway][5])                           | “...after the **Passover**.” ([Bible Gateway][6])                                | **Different calendar/meaning**: “Easter” vs “Passover” isn’t just style—one is Christian festival language, the other is explicitly Jewish Passover timing. |
| **Romans 8:1**       | “...no condemnation... **who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit**.” ([Bible Gateway][7]) | “...no condemnation **for those who are in Christ Jesus**.” ([Bible Gateway][8]) | **Condition changes**: KJV makes “no condemnation” read as tied to a behavior/qualifier; NIV states it without that added clause.                           |
| **John 1:18**        | “...the **only begotten Son**... he hath declared him.” ([Bible Gateway][9])                         | “...the one and only Son, **who is himself God**...” ([Bible Gateway][10])       | **Different theological force**: NIV’s main line explicitly calls the Son “God,” while KJV’s phrasing doesn’t say that outright here.                       |
| **Revelation 22:14** | “Blessed are they that **do his commandments**...” ([Bible Gateway][11])                             | “Blessed are those who **wash their robes**...” ([Bible Gateway][12])            | **Different basis for “right to the tree of life”**: obedience framing vs cleansing/robe-washing framing.                                                   |
| **Revelation 22:19** | “...God shall take away his part out of the **book of life**...” ([Bible Gateway][13])               | “...take away... any share in the **tree of life**...” ([Bible Gateway][14])     | **Different object entirely**: “book of life” vs “tree of life” changes the imagery and the claim being made.                                               |

| **Daniel 3:25**         | He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. | He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.” | KJV is moneitheism. NIV reads polytheistic |
| **Luke 2:14**        | Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. | Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”  | Is it universally all men vs selectively only to those receiving favor? |

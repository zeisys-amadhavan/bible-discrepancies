| Book / ref           | KJV                                                                                       | NIV                                                               | Contradiction                                                                                                                        |

| **Daniel 3:25**         | He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. | He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.” | KJV says the fourth man is the Son of God. NIV says he looks like a son of the gods—monetheism vs polytheism. |
| **Luke 2:14**        | Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. | Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”  | KJV says peace and goodwill are for everyone. NIV says peace is for only those God favors—universal blessing vs selective blessing. |
| **Acts 12:4**           | And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. |  After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. | KJV says Herod waited until Easter. NIV says he waited until Passover—a Christian holiday vs a Jewish one, changing the time and context. |
| **Romans 8:1**       | There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. | Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, | KJV: “No condemnation” comes with a behavior condition. NIV: “No condemnation” is a promise for all in Christ, period. |
| **Revelation 22:14** |  Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. | Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. | KJV says you enter by obeying God’s commandments. NIV says you enter by maintaining hygeine—obedience vs cleansing as the reason you can enter. |
| **Revelation 22:19** | And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. | And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll. | KJV warns God will remove you from the book of life. NIV says God will remove your share in the tree of life |
| **Isaiah 14:12**     | How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! | How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth,  you who once laid low the nations! | Lucifer = Morning Star? Revelations 1 22:16 says " “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.” |
| **Luke 2:33**        | And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. | The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. | Is it Joseph the child's father? |
| **Mark 1:2**         | As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. | as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way” | All prophets. Major prophets. Or Isaiah? |
| **Philippians 2:6**  | Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God | Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; | KJV focuses on who Jesus is (equal with God, not stolen). NIV focuses on what he chose (didn’t exploit that equality). |
| **1 John 5:7–8**   | For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. | For there are three that testify | KJV adds: Father, Word, and Holy Spirit testify in heaven and “these three are one.” NIV leaves that line out and only says three testify. |
| **Mark 16:9–20**   | No disclaimer | Disclaimer: The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 9–20. | So not original? |
| **John 7:53–8:11** | No disclaimer | Disclaimer: The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53—8:11. A few manuscripts include these verses, wholly or in part, after John 7:36, John 21:25, Luke 21:38 or Luke 24:53. | So not original? |
| **Matthew 6:13** | And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. | And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. | Later addition? |
| **Acts 8:36-38** | 36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. | 36 As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?” 37 DISCLAIMER: Some manuscripts include here Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” The eunuch answered, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” 38 And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.  | Later addition? |
